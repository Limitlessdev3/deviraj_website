                                If you’re one of the many allied health clinics experiencing a drop in patient bookings and staff morale, growing your practice back to the healthy turnover pre-pandemic is likely to be top priority.

                                If you’ve tried strategies such as increasing advertising, mailouts, newsletters and meeting with doctors, you’d likely have discovered that all of this has little impact on your clinic’s ability to increase client retention. You may get new clients but they don’t stay with your practice.

                                    While your staff lack the confidence or skills to engage patients into effective treatment plans, you’re stuck dealing with visits on an as needs basis determined by the patient and not the clinician.

  <h4>Earlier, first week, I thought the treatment would not work but I was wrong. The treatment worked wonderfully. All the anger, anxeity, irritation reduced tremendously. I become more calm, patient and now started thinking positively. I am motivated to do wonders and at any cost I am going to buy father's dream car. Counselling was very helpful. Mrs. Priya took great initiative to help me our. I did different types of exercises which helped me to understand the gravity of the situation more. various topics were discussed and methods to overcome my problems. All were best sessions. I Am really really happy that my father brought me here. Many changes for the good has happened over the past 4 weeks. And it will stay like this forever. I have become more extrovert, confident, very happy, joyful and down to earth and happy go with. Thank you very much.</h4>

  <h4>I was very stressed out and sad during this pandemic and hopeless about my future. So when I searched for the right hospital, counselling centre, or clinic to get counselled for my stress, I learned about this hospital in Trichy. I had a good experience here. The chief doctor Dr Ramakrishnan attended my case, and he was so concerned about my stressful life events and asked me to meet a counsellor. So I was counselled for 2 hours and now continuously visiting once a week. It is the best hospital in the city, even in the Tamilnadu state, where one could get a solution for psychological problems. So I recommend this hospital for quality treatment and psychological counselling and therapies.</h4>

  <h4>My sister had panic attacks. She used to worry a lot about everything and never met people due to this anxiety and fear. So I was carefully searching for a good mental health institute or counselling center to give counselling. Lucky we landed here. After attending eight sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy sessions, the experienced psychologist explained to me her plan. Now she is fine and started showing improvements. Athma is the best counselling center for youth and adult mental problems.</h4>
